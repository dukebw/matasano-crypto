This is a repository full of cryptography-related programs I've written as I
work through "Introduction to Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell".

The cipher programs require you to set a MESSAGE environment variable (the
message to be encrypted), and a KEY environment variable (the key used to
encrypt the message). The attack programs require you to set a CIPHER
environment variable (the cipher to be decrypted).

Make by setting the P environment variable to the program and typing make.
E.g. P=vigenere_attack make
